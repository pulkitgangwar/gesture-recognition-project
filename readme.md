# Gesture Recognition Project 
> Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

## General Information
- The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
  - Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
  - Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
  - Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
  - Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
  - Stop: Pause the movie



## Conclusions
- The Best model is MobileNetV2 + GRU with accuracy of 0.79 and val accuracy of 0.73 




## Technologies Used
- tensorflow - version 2.13.0
- matplotlib - version 3.6.2
- numpy - version 1.22.3
- pandas - version 1.5.2
- tensorflow.keras - version 2.6.0
